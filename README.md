# Rails API for Book Appoinment App

This Rails API is a simple course app with basic functionalities and consists of implementing a Ruby on Rails back-end with JWT Bearer authentication using bcrypt & JWT gems.

Main functionalities are:

- Sign-up/Login users with dedicated endpoints
- Creating/Deleting courses with dedicated endpoints

My learning purpose based on practicing basic authentication with JWT, creating API endpoints to consume it with a separate front end and preparing an automated API documentation with rswag gem.

API documentation is created by using rswag. Documentation use case examples for user sign-ups/logins and adding/deleting of the courses implemented by configuring Swagger-YAML.

## How to use this API

- Clone this repository by following these [steps](#Getting-Started).
